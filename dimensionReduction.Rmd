## What?

You have all encountered data that seems to have a lot of columns. 

What variables are important? 

Without any theory, how do you select which variables to include in a model?

We can use a variety of methods to reduce many variables into a smaller set of variables.

## Methods

We are going to discuss 2 main techniques:

Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)

## An Important Note

These are both matrix factorization techniques. 

- Like many other dimension reduction methods.

Despite what you might hear, these two are not the same thing.

## Which To Use?

There is only one consideration!

The causal direction.

## 

In PCA, the component exists because of the variables.

In EFA, the variables exist because of the factor.
