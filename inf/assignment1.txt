2 points per task for 10 total points

# Task 1 #

Read in the following data: "https://www3.nd.edu/~sberry5/data/allReviews.RData"

You will need to download the data and then read it in with the following:

load("folder/allReviews.RData")

The object is called "allReviews".

Engage in some data exploration by using different summary functions. 
In addition to the summary() function, the describe functions from the psych and Hmisc packages are great (but for slightly different purposes). 


# Task 2 #

How do those variables look? Do they appear to all make sense? Are there any extreme values? Are any of them coded in such a way that don't make sense? Discuss anything interesting that you found.

Be sure to use the str() function or the glimpse() function from dplyr to check the structure of the data.

# Task 3 #

Pick at least 3 variables for which you want to explore relationships. Given any issues you found in Task 2, convert variables as needed with as.factor (forces a variable into a factor), as.numeric (forces a variable into a numeric), or anything else that you deem necessary (e.g., create new variables with mutate). 

# Task 4 #

Using the ggplot2 package, create some visualizations. The structure of a ggplot object is as follows:

ggplot(yourData, aes(x = variableOnX, y = variableOnY)) + 
geom_point()


If you want to add some type of grouped function (by color, for instance), you might do something like this:

ggplot(yourData, aes(x = variableOnX, y = variableOnY, color = variableToColor)) + 
geom_point()


Once you have produced a visualization, explain what it means. Naturally, good viz doesn't need explanation, but let's do it regardless!

# Task 5 #

Apophenia is real...

Using the inferviz package (devtools::install_github('saberry/qualtricsR')), use the simViz function to see how well you actually do in finding an actual relationship.

First, pick two new variables for relationship exploration -- make sure that you have not seen them before.

When you run it the first time, keep the distractors argument at the default value. When asked if you want to see the real data select 1 (No). Now try it with more distractors (maybe 5 or 6).

How did you do? Where you able to spot the real relationship or were you fooled by your basic human need for pattern finding?

Discuss what you think this means.
