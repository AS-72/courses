Employee turnover is an important issue for all organization, but it is a big problem for some organizations. In our data, we have the number of days employed (daysEmployed) in the last 365 days. Anyone who worked less than 365 days, quit. You will notice that very few employees actually stuck around all year. 

Task 1

How many people were employed for the entire duration (i.e., how many were there for all 365 days)?

Task 2

What variables might explain the number of days employed? Formulate, specify, and report your hypotheses. 

Task 3

Use one of the functions that will cover glm techniques (lm for a linear regression model, t.test for a t-test, or aov for an anova) to test your hypotheses and report your findings. 

Task 4

Explore the data a little bit more. Produce one visualization and explain the relationship.
