# The Data

Just to keep things light and easy, let's just play with the `mtcars` data (boring -- yes; useful -- yes). 

First, let's revist a linear model with mpg as the DV and 

```{r}
simpleModel = lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

summary(simpleModel)
```

We can see that weight has a pretty strong effect on mpg. When looking at our data, though, we might notice a few variables that naturally group out data:

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

Variables like `cyl`, `gear`, and `am` might all be suitable grouping variables. With one of those variables, try a mixed model with a random intercept.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

library(lme4)
```

In comparison to our standard linear model, is this mixed model providing any additional information? What happened to the coefficient and the standard errors between the models.
