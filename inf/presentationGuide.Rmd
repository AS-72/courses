Each part (Checks) will have a maximum of 10 points awarded.

```{r}
dat = data.frame(Checks = c("Clearly-Stated Hypotheses", 
                           "General Creativity", 
                           "Interpretation", 
                           "Appropriate technique use", 
                           "Transparency"), 
                 Notes = c("Did you clearly state your hypotheses?", 
                           "Did you find some data of interest or are you talking about how to read a csv&#8253;", 
                           "Did you interpret your results?", 
                           "Did you use the proper method to test your hypotheses and create visualizations?", 
                           "Is your code presented and reproducible?"))

knitr::kable(dat)
```

Going over three minutes will be handsomely rewarded.~
