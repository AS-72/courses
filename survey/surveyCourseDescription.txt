Surveys, like all scientific tools, require great care in their design and implementation -- and just like other scientific tools, research can be ruined if surveys are not properly used. In this course, we will learn how to develop, administer, and analyze surveys. Our areas of focus will be on writing and ordering questions to produce your desired data (in other words, data that you can actually use to test your hypotheses), fielding surveys with a variety of technologies, and how to appropriately analyze survey responses. All coursework will be oriented towards having a well-crafted survey that is ready for use in the field or online. We will utilize Qualtrics and Open Data Kit as our primary survey tools and we will use R to perform our data cleaning and analyses.
