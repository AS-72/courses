"2","Provided a stepping stone toward a more promising career, the best time at the company, was leaving.. It seems as if there is a lacking management work ethic within the company. Idiots, hiring more idiots.As a consequence, entire departments are brought together consisting of even more idiots. Bringing in staff who are not qualified to do the job, staff who are lazy, lacking work ethic, and have no get up and go. Progression, and learning are none existant.Senior management are completely inept, with tales of bullying and harrassment all too common. Lacking in any and all perspective of what is happening on the office floors of their company, management are too busy day dreaming about a make believe image they have built up of the company and are surrounding themselves with, we don't need REDACTED Benefits and Sunflower seeds posted to our doors, we need change..

The work is pretty interesting, and the people are awesome. Some of the great things about the firm are the accessibilty of partners and knowledge capital.. They often talk about maintaining work-life balance. The fact is, there is no such thing. In order to over-deliver at the client and work on side projects(which you must do to get promoted), many colleagues end up putting in 100+ hours a week.The also talk about REDACTED being a transparent firm, I found this to not be the case either from partner leads (regarding my performance) or from leadership (regarding certain strategic decisions).. Please practice what you preech regarding transparency.","E201S"

The lowest pay you can ever find in the market compared to other IT consulting companies, not even to mention management consulting.3. Limited personal career development opportunities.

There is no structure in the company, no structured way to evaluate employees' performance, no transparency about salary increment and promotion criteria.5. The management does not listen to you.

"31","When I first interviewed for REDACTED / STEP STRATEGY and saw the Glassdoor Reviews, I wrongfully doubted the value of the summer internship program. However, after spending a summer with REDACTED / STEP STRATEGY,, I cannot thank Sharona and the team enough. As a University of Virginia student, I came into the program with some experience in a Series B start-up, but no management consulting experience. To my surprise, I was placed in a beautiful open office overlooking a mountain range in Brentwood, one of the most affluent neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California. On one of my first days I was taken on site to a credit retailer with over $600 million in annual revenue and worked with the principals on a systems analysis of the accounting, merchandising, floor planning, and customer relations systems. The office runs quite like a start-up company. Each intern comes from some of the most elite schools in the country and brings a unique perspective and network to the program. I had the privilege to pitch my own ideas to the principals of the firm, who have high profile connections to top CEOs in Los Angeles and Israel. When my ideas were determined valuable, I was given the freedom to work on my own projects throughout the summer, culminating in an event in August where we met C-Suite management in cutting edge virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming, entertainment, ad-tech, venture capital, angel investing, production, cybersecurity, and technology firms. Whether a high-growth start-up in Silicon Beach that just closed a $60M funding round or a billion-dollar established enterprise, I saw first-hand how Sharona commands the respect and admiration of power players in business. We even got to meet Yossi Vardi, the Godfather of Israels hi-tech industry, which is now the second start-up ecosystem in the world with $2.8 billion invested in the first half of 2016 next to Silicon Valley. Yes, Sharona has high expectations for the work you deliver but these expectations were only to help the interns develop as professionals. I believe that the previous Glassdoor reviewers just may not have the ability to take constructive criticism and use it to inspire better work habits. Each day we have access to a kitchen filled with snacks and drinks. In fact, we either all go out for free lunch or order free lunch to the office, where we discuss recent M&A activity and business news over a meal. Bottom line is I appreciate Sharona for developing me professionally and turning an amateur management consultant to an analyst with contacts throughout the business world and experience with multi-million dollar clients. I would even recommend the program over a more well-known firm because the ability to work intimately with experienced PwC principals gave me more experience and access than I would have as just another intern at the bottom of the totem pole in a bigger firm.. The need to adapt to constructive criticism.. Keep hiring high power interns.","X278H"

"40","Decent benefits and interesting strategic projects. As a former Kurt Salmon employee, I was skeptical when REDACTED acquired KS for several reasons: 1. REDACTEDs lack of reputation/poor brand recognition in the market 2. Lower compensation/benefits packages. 3. Unclear strategic vision for the future of the firm. 4. Client work quality okay at best (all surface, no substance). However, I remained optimistic and stuck around to see how well the two firms would integrate. MISTAKE. It only took a short time to learn that (in addition to all of the above) REDACTEDs overall culture and morale, lack of transparency from leadership, and treatment of their employees was disappointing at best.-Culture and morale: REDACTED has an outdated, office-based culture (Why do traveling consultants need offices in 2017?), resulting in largely empty offices with low morale. There is an unreasonable expectation that staff bill 100% of their time (85% billable work and 15% PTO) and billable hours/timesheets are micromanaged down to the second (e.g. I see that you have 4 hours free this week. To fill your time, please copy and paste your life away and bill it to a client). Consultants are often doing busy work that adds nothing to their professional development simply to fill up timesheets. This results in extremely overworked, poorly managed, burnt out, and undervalued staff.-Lack of transparency from leadership: Major decisions are being made at the top and employees are not notified until leadership cannot hide it anymore. For example, firing the entire marketing department, cancelling the summer internship program, and letting go 25-30 legacy KS employees (& several other REDACTED consultants) is something that has downstream implications to remaining employees. Yet, REDACTED leadership denied it as rumors and continues to do so not only in the press, but on Glassdoor (look at their responses to reviews). Its sad that leadership would rather protect their reputation as the best place to work than be honest about whats actually happening. Judging by the major staff reductions coupled with their public claims of strong growth, it appears that leadership is positioning to sell the company.-Treatment of employees: Consultants are treated as workhorses, expected to make the firm look good or make money at every moment. Leadership appears cheap (cancellation of company retreats/consultant bootcamps) and solely profit-driven. Employees have been asked to share glowing reviews on public forums (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc) to beef up appearances.. Consulting is a human capital business and the world of healthcare management consulting is small. Treat your employees poorly, and you will feel the results sooner or later. Dont deny the honest, constructive feedback provided on forums like Glassdoor. Spend some time evaluating your business internally and being a little more self-aware.","F448U"

"56","AMC has been acquiring properties to manage left and right, so the growth opportunity is very positive and probable. AMC likes to promote within, so opportunities come available sooner than you may think. The office culture is very casual and friendly; you won't find upper management in 3 piece suits and refusing to speak to the ""little people"", aka the ""assistants and leasing staff."" It's great to work for a company that actually follows and maintains the ""open door"" policy. Upper management is very approachable, and definitely serves as true mentors in your career. I have been extremely fortunate to work under (in my opinion..) the absolute best Regional Manager, ever. Being able to express my concerns, asking for career guidance, requesting more challenging opportunities, and even just being able to vent about reports has been great. Even with having one of the largest portfolios in the company, this RPM has made sure to tend to each and every property AND employee with the utmost attention, and in a very timely manner. Be it 6am, or 11pm, and you need some assistance with your duties, the RPM makes them self available and values your effort, drive, dedication, and even perfectionist persona.The pay rate is very decent. I wouldn't say the best, but very competitive. The plus to an average base pay is the opportunity for some amazing bonuses.The hours are standard, and AMC does seem to understand and push for a good work-life balance. The on-site staff at nearly every property I've visited has been extremely friendly and knowledgable. Working with AMC does not feel like working for a large corporation, where they address you by your employee number. Rather, it feels more like a family; we are brothers and sisters (our cousins if we're in different portfolios :) ). You get positive feed back, and constructive criticism from all levels of upper management, including the VP, President, and the owners of the respected property. Each level of the management tier truly does show their appreciation for their employees, and they do whatever they can to ensure everyone is happy in their position and with their career path. AMC has helped me find more than a job; they've help me create a positive and upwards-going career, and I will forever be grateful for the guidance, support, generosity, and career training they've provided myself and my staff.. The overall benefits package is very so-so; 80/20 coverage, only one provider, no options, no 401k match, no company paid life insurance, no employee assistance. There also needs to be structure and written policy amongst the company to make transitioning from one property to another easier. Each community has it's own ways of doing things, there is no set policy, and you kind of make it up as you go, unless you have a great mentor who is willing to guide you (which in my case, I did!) Property staffing is normally limited, and 75-% your property will be short handed because another property needed coverage. Having access to credible temp workers, floaters, etc would help so much with basic efficiency at the property level.. Provide options and better coverage levels for health insurance. Also provide more hands on training, employee education reimbursement for acquiring PM certification/accreditation, and give us our drop boxes back! Having more efficient accounting software that is more user friendly and adaptable to change would be great! And going to a 30, or even 45 day notice rather than a 60 day would really help with resident satisfaction and retention. Having a better online rent-pay option that does not have such steep fees would be amazing! And having proper staff coverage would make a huge difference.","T921J"

Just know that, and read all the reviews before you make your decision to recruit on campus at SP Jain or other B Schools. Implement project reviews that has a check-in with all project teams weekly, so no EM can let a project languish and no Director can come in last day and demand all new work.

"108","It was a pleasant winter morning & I stepped in REDACTED on 11th Dec,1991 as an office assistant.Wow!! 25 years at REDACTED has been an incredible journey. It is a reflective moment. I was young, energetic and full of great expectations. The management gave me my first break with an opportunity for working in the accounts department as an Accountant & after that I have been climbing up every step of my career.Back then we were barely 25 employees, 20 of us were bachelors and we worked together day and night as a family & friends & not as employees.Before joining REDACTED, I have never seen a computer & was not even comfortable speaking in English.Thanks to the emphasis on continuous learning & training at REDACTED, now I am not only an expert with my computer but also technically sound in my area of work & my communication skills.I never dreamt of seeing an aero plane. In REDACTED I was given plenty of opportunities.My first flight journey was to New Delhi in 2005 to visit Bangladesh embassy.My first International trip was to Cornell University, Ithaca and New York was in 2010 for meeting on project finance planning. This helped me in improving my skills in International accounting and the intricacies of project finance planning.And followed were many more trips like Singapore, Sydney, Australia for various workshops & to REDACTED SUMMER OFFICE with family ..The management continuously recognized my sincerity & hard work and kept rewarding and motivating me. Over the years I have won multiple awards & few to mention are:      Best performance award in 2012-13 & 2016 -17      Long service award in 2015 along with ten other colleges who completed 10 yearsThere are plenty of events & activities at REDACTED & I participate in every activity to balance my work life.I have also been able to share miles of smiles with my family at home & my parents at my village.I have seen the company grow and at every step the management supported every one of us to grow with the company.For me even after 25 years, every day is a fresh start and a new learning. I would like to let my younger colleagues know that in REDACTED Opportunities are unlimited and one just has to work hard and grab them.. - n i l -. keep the momentum going","U356H"

The partners truly lead by example with high energy of performance and work integrity. Knowledge sharing and direct communication is encouraged.There is a solid pipeline of client projects which keeps the team of consultants in high demand. The internal culture of over-achieving and over-delivering drives success with the clients. Most of the clients are local to California, which is pretty good.Bottom line, REDACTED is a great place to put your functional and technical skills to the test, apply your passion for business and technology, and see the fruits of your labor manifest in some tangible results. I feel that I'm always acknowledged with praise and pay for good delivery.. Lot of great projects to choose from, hard to keep up with the pros.

The client list was really top notch, and the level of senior executive client interaction was very high, even from the moment I joined the firm. The project responsibilities I was given from day one were remarkably impactful and I felt like a contributor to a client's success right away.. The biggest issue I saw was with compensation. If you got a mid year promotion, you didn't get a pay raise until the end of the year, which was actually very disheartening. Compensation at the top level is not really known outside of the Directorship and it made it hard to know what the carrot was. There was a lot of speculation at the Associate level on salary increases and potential at the other levels, but people were very tight lipped about compensation overall.

"174","FMC is a company made up of a group of driven and inspired people determined to not only make a success of the business, but make a success of each individual they hire. Alongside a competitive salary, there are numerous benefits and opportunities that come with working at FMC; training and development, bonuses, childcare vouchers, healthcare, company trips, fitness challenges and huge Christmas parties. My personal favourite activities have been completing Tough Mudder, climbing Snowdon and taking over a country manor for the mother of all house parties.My 3.5 years at FMC were incredibly positive; I moved from the recruitment team (8 months) into the marketing dept where I spent the remainder of my time. I was offered a lot of support during the transition, given 1-2-1 training with our systems providers and had regular meetings with my MD and manager. I was given the freedom to work on my own projects, could always ask for help when I needed it and always felt encouraged to do my best and given pep-talks when I lacked confidence, felt frustrated or had a lazy period. During periods where I would clash with my manager, we would resolve things in the boardroom and create plans of how to better work together, resulting in a strong team dynamic. Yes, in a sales environment there are KPI's and targets to meet, and if you fall below target you will be monitored, but you will be supported and get the help you need and ask for. The difference with FMC is that if you show willing, you will be given a chance to turn things around, for a much longer period than most companies would entertain.At FMC, you will find;- An informal, yet professional culture where you don't have to leave your personality at the door.- A team that works with professional integrity.- Positive reinforcement, training and development where needed.- Modern offices- An open-door whether you need help with your work, your specialism, or your personal life.- A team of really friendly, dynamic people who support each other, live together and socialise together giving the office a friendly/family environment. They celebrate each others successes, go to each others weddings and rally through difficult times. This is a very unique set of people who were wonderful to work with.- A Management Team and MD who genuinely care for your well-being, get to know you personally and understand how to help you with your weakness and build up your strengths.- Experienced professionals with specialised (and international) markets willing to teach you and develop you.- A professional ladder that is quick and easy to climb if you are willing to put the work in...graduates have been promoted to Account Managers in less than a year!During my time at FMC I had a great group of friends to work with, felt incredibly supported in pursuing my career goals and still maintain the positive relationships I built.. It's hard to think of cons, sometimes parking is a little tricky and sales/ target driven environments aren't for everyone.Overall FMC were fantastic to work for and I would return in a heart beat..

"175","REDACTED is an extremely high quality firm with very satisfied clients. The best part about working here is the quality of the consultants around you. Everyone is extremely intelligent and passionate about their work. Projects are typically interesting, complicated, and leading edge in terms of the industry.Opportunities for promotion are significant.. REDACTED is an historically small firm and has had trouble scaling in recent years to a large firm with multiple locations, broad services, and limited culture. There is very little HR support in terms of the annual review process and promotion criteria differ significantly from manager to manager. Work life balance is limited at best with client deadlines pushed to the forefront and often poor planning leads to weekend work sessions and all night deliverable preparation.Travel can be significant (Mon-Thur) for months at a time in some cases but more typically this job is a lonely desk job in a private office where office socializing is discouraged in favor of billing time.Culture is poorly defined and lags behind similar firms in terms of team building, trust, and transparent promotion process. Instead of one company with a strong central culture the feeling among employees is more of individuals working on individual projects with random levels of oversight and limited collaboration. REDACTED does a poor job of developing ""4 star"" talent into 5 star talent. In other words, individuals that would succeed anywhere do well at REDACTED but anyone that might be a 5 star with a little development rarely receives the development they need and typically leave.. Simply, the culture of the organization is not set up to allow for the scaling planned.My advice would be to invest in culture building outside of traditional methods (summer conference, occasional social events). Instead, backlog professional develop hours for office lunches, mentoring, etc. and create a culture that discourages employees from working during these sessions. Right now, the culture set by leadership is one that expects consultants to work during all division meetings, late nights, and weekends all in the interest of client work, even if formal announcements say otherwise. This culture will not scale or retain talent.Invest in knowledge sharing and the development of consultants with targeted training and formal mentoring sessions with leaders across the firm. Enforce consistent management processes across all practices and managers and increase HR function to bring formality and professionalism to the people planning strategy.","C211B"

Overtime pay = time and a half, however employees are often banned from submitting overtime hours during ""financial cut backs"". Management sexually harassed multiple female employees for 2 years, employees reached out to higher ups asking for HR contacts, were told there were no HR representatives on staff and there was nothing they could do about it. (This was a lie, employees later found out there are 2 HR representatives on staff) Took 2 years of abuse to rid the company of the harrassers. There is no employee handbook so corporate office is able to make up rules at-will. Examples of made up rules include unscheduled leave during government office OMB closures: during snowmeggedon in DC when the government was closed for 8 days in 2010 and contractors were unable to work, REDACTED forced employees to use their vacation days. If an employee did not have enough vacation days, they were forced to make it up during overtime. Employees earn vacation days extremely slowly, it takes a full year of work to earn 10 vacation days. There are no sick days, you must use your vacation days. Weird accounting system. Employees MUST work a full 8 hr day each week, even if you work 9-10 hr days during the rest of the week and amass the normal 40+ hr workweek, but worked a 7 hr day, you must use 1 hr of vacation time..

"194","Every individual at the firm produces excellent work, from the smallest internal work product to massive client deliverables. There is strong focus on quality of deliverables for both content and design, with consultants expected to create diverse, visually appealing deliverables efficiently. Peers and managers often provide a reference to an expert within the firm for content areas where a consultant may not be comfortable working alone. Every individual is passionate about their work and engagements are typically interesting and innovative.. REDACTED was successful in increasing its size over the recent years, but the management did not anticipate and proactively grow administrative support in kind. The firm only brought on a CFO and CHRO at a point where the organization had almost 200 consultants, leading to policies that were confusing for both existing and new staff members. The firm boasts about its entrepreneurial spirit, but the focus on office-based consulting is dated and dis-incentivizes younger employees. Office-based consulting doesn't foster collegiality in small locations where there may only by 15 consultants and 75% of the office is traveling. Firm culture is confusing - legacy/lifelong REDACTED managers seem to have different expectations for social interactions and those expectations vary wildly between offices. Senior leadership does communicate the need to work over 40 hours, with a goal of 40 billable hours per week. However, work commitment expectations vary between senior managers, so setting personal boundaries to try and stabilize work-life balance is impossible for new employees. Consultants do not consistently work with the same project teams and are expected to adjust to new management styles without much support. Much lip service is paid to professional development but it is difficult to guarantee face-to-face time with administrative managers. It is hard to maintain motivation and remain engaged when backlog hours fluctuate and management is inaccessible.. The new Consultant Development Lead will hopefully correct the quality and consistency of professional development support. Employee communications should be clearer - even the new meeting structure is confusing with regards to attendance expectations. Continued attention to appropriately addressing the company's expansion is necessary to retain and motivate the expert staff at REDACTED.","H841K"

Received my so-called leads on Saturday. All lead cards read with positive messages such as: ""he is excited you're local"", ""he's anticipating the meeting"", ""they are open to the discussion"", ""they'd love to take advantage of what we have to offer"", etc. I drove 180 miles (to the appoinments and back home) that Monday. Of the 5 leads, I saw 1. He said he didn't get a call and is already sserviced by someone else. The other 4 were NO GOOD. Like the others said, you can complain to management but they'll tell you ""hang in there. You must have done something wrong."" The same every no is closer to a yes.

Unpredictable hours - you often might not know in advance whether you will have to work late, which can make it difficult to schedule your social life. This is to some extent the name of the game in consulting, and I do not think REDACTED is worse than its peers in this respect, but it could still be managed better.Limited input on staffing - you might not be put on projects which you feel are most interesting or would most further your career. Again, this is not unique to REDACTED, but can be frustrating regardless.. Be careful to maintain the culture.

"274","Used to be a great place to work for.. Since the takeover through REDACTED a few year back, the company has lost its way and become just an extended arm of the mega-outsourcing behemoth that is REDACTED. In fact, the name ""Lodestone"" is already gone, and the company is now only called ""REDACTED Consulting"".When I joined, I asked whether the culture would change from its European roots, and the partner said that the consulting branch would always be treated differently from the main AMS and Development departments. Well, that partner is now gone, together with most of the other good people that used to work there. Most of the former Lodestone senior leadership is gone, too. Administration and IT was successively moved to India, with disastrous results for productivity and efficiency of basic functions like invoicing and timesheet management. Bit by bit, ridiculous kindergarten rules were introduced with regards to procedures and processes. Those may be required to keep fresh-grads in India under control but are totally useless and insulting to senior consulting staff. Finally, performance reviews were slowly changed towards rewarding the ""appearance of effort"" (such as spending long times in the office or doing cherry-picked jobs for the boss instead of real project work or helping colleagues). That means that even if you worked off your butt for a client, you might just end up in the middle of the bell curve and score an ""average"" final performance result, with accordingly negative effects on your bonus and promotion chances.Conclusion: If you like micromanagement, byzantine processes, inefficiencies, and cronyism, this might be a good place to work at now. But if you were looking for management and IT consulting excellence, a relaxed European mindset that rewards responsibility and client-focused work, stay away. Speaking to people who have recently left or are still working there, morale among ex-Lodestone folks has slowly reached rock bottom.. Return to the roots of what made Lodestone a globally successful company and respected name. But I think management is actually fully committed to the cultural shift occurring there, so such advice is rather futile.","F248Z"

I had been gainfully employed before accepting the position with ManCon, and left that position for this one. I am now living in a homeless shelter with my three children, because the management at this company has ZERO compassion.Additionally, during my time there, it was made clear that you are not allowed to take breaks, nor make or take personal phone calls during your break. I was followed into the break room and told that the cameras are used to track people throughout the day to ensure they're not taking breaks. Pretty creepy, to be honest.. Don't ever hire someone from out of state again. Please. You literally destroyed my life. We have been homeless for about six months now, due to your lack of understanding or compassion. I moved my family across the country for this job, and you fired me with no remorse because my child was sick. That was incredibly heartless and cruel.","T934V"

"331","This company doesnt really have any pro's. All the good reviews are fake reviews written by HR or other obedient disciples of sr. management or by those with no self-esteem. The only pro I would add is holiday party with open bar where everyone likes to get drunk, not feel the pain of working in this company and smile.. The cons are a mile long but here are few:1. ZERO work-life balance: Everyone in services department ends up work minimum of 12 hours a day with few working till midnight.2. Management only cares for utilization: Management has been pushing for certain amount of utilization which is not practical for 95% of the employees, rest 5% achieve while working on projects in Europe and become the star of services team. Due to this every employee ends up losing yearly bonus which has been a joke for last few years.3. Bad salary: Janitor of the building where headquarter is located has a better annual income than Implementation consultants(IC) even after working less hours. Management comes up with a bluff of a plan once in a while to increase salary to market rate but it never happens. Everyone in our department is paid a salary from 80's with promotion plan as a joke and annual salary hike which would only makes us ashamed of yourself.4. Yearly bonus- Management makes you work hard throughout the year on a promise of 10% annual performance bonus but ends up paying no more than half of it because they are bunch of thief's and like to steal from its own employees.5. High turnover- In just one year 10+ Tech ICs/ICs and 4 Sr.ICs have left REDACTED. This has become a trend and talented people who had been here for 5+ years are leaving after being sick and tired of work culture at REDACTED.6. No respect for employees or their ideas- Individual views dont matter at REDACTED. Voices and concerns are heard, plans are made but no action is ever taken. Owners of this company are talented orators who cannot walk the talk. Not even a single services employee has any motivation left to work in this company and aggressively looking for better job opportunities.. No point in giving advice to sr. management on this website as they would never understand the meaning of invest in employees. Enough feedback has been provided in companys internal anonymous survey and in person to Sr.ICs/Managers who got tired of the company and left.","Q396I"

"333","The quality of engagements are good, you can get significant client exposure pretty early in your consulting career, you do some real good problem solving at times and learn some of the consulting nuances (how to design decks, manage clients, dress, survive on less sleep, multitask etc.). I think it was one of the best decisions I made, to quit. I slogged, I learnt and when things started to get ugly I left.The culture pretty much gets driven by the founder, MD who somehow feels that his employees are his slaves and that's the culture driven throughout the company. Most of the other directors behave such because they are also being treated such. (They don't have a partnership model, so you might give your life to the company but you will still end up being at best a director but not a partner). There are some surprising things which I have seen here. Your boss calling at 3:30 AM in the morning to create and finalize a proposal by 7:00 AM just because he could not get the time to do it in the last 2 days. Getting yelled at just because your boss is unable to manage his work and someone has to be shouted at. Being made to do your boss' son's college assignment????? wow!!I can ramble on, but this organization is only advisable if you don't have too much of self respect..

"336","The company has a lot of education opportunities available to people that want to take part in it. You can get certifications and training to help you grow your career.. The company hires fully trained and qualified people from the companies they are receiving contracts from. These peoples already know the job that the contract is supporting and came from the team that had previously supported it. Once they get procedures in place and feel they can have anyone else do the job, whether true or not, they lay off the original employees and replace them with people right out of college for 1/3 the wages. The people they hire out of college are not usually US citizens so they hire them for even less. They throw away people that know the job and the customer and are willing to work any hours to get the job done and keep the customer happy. They replace them with people that know nothing, do not care about the customer or their job since they are usually there just to get job experience and training. They create a revolving door of people supporting the customers. The customers become very upset. The quality of work goes down the drain and they eventually lose the contract of most of the servers they were supporting are taken back to support by the customer.. Keep the people that know what they are doing and are dedicated to their jobs and their customers. You can save a buck and loose the company with the current methods.

"348","The only pro listed above is really a con. They do everything they can to work with people and keep people because the salary, commission, and bonus structure are BS! I am a real salesman and have been in sales for over a decade.(I wouldn't still be doing it if I wasn't successful). In any job where I made a sale, I got paid. NOT HERE FOLKS!! Your salary in every position is dependent on what they guy involved in the process after you does. If he fails you don't get paid. Let me break it down for you. The idea is to get a consulting project for the company. It starts with a Business Coordinator doing some appointment setting for a sales rep. IF he gets an appointment (and the leads are absolutely terrible/ wrong names, wrong addresses, out of business, income incompatible; 65% of the companies leads in its decade old database are no good) the sales rep that goes to the appointment MUST convince the client he needs an Analyst for you to get your commission!!! Once the sales rep/ SAM sells it (if he does) He doesn't get paid unless the Analyst he sends in after he leaves collects an analysis fee (which the client has an option not to pay, given to him in writing) Also even if the client is convinces he needs an Analysts, the company has way less Analysts than reps so they may not even send the Analyst, thus no pay for the rep. If the Analysts is successful in convincing the client he needs consulting, the Analysts doesn't get paid until the consulting fees are collected! SO IN A NUT SHELL, YOU CAN BE THE VERY BEST AT YOUR JOB AND NEVER MAKE A CENT!! I was an INSIDE sales rep which is the same as an outside one in pay structure but i did my sales over the phone. I made quite a few Analysts appointments in my short time in that department but they didn't send out an Analyst even once!! (in my opinion, due to work place politics: If your not in bed with the management, your last on the list) So I moved to the Business Coordinator department to do appointment setting. Even with horrible leads I managed to begin the upper 50% of my department in performance from day one in the department. I was only there for 3 weeks and generated 50 SOLID leads for the reps. The clients I had told me everything about their companies and my reps knew exactly what they needed to do. Out of 50 leads generated only 2 resulted in an Analyst being sent and only 1 fee collected. Long Story short: AFTER 10 YEARS AS A SUCCESSFUL SALESMAN, I WAS REDUCED TO MINIMUM WAGE!! I stayed with REDACTED (and their list of alias names) for 3 months and never saw more than $320 for a weeks work!! When I put in my 2 weeks notice, I was told not to worry about two weeks and to just take it as time off (unpaid of course) so I was essentially fired. Luckily I had another job with a former employer in less than an hour. I quit on a Monday and was supposes to have received a paycheck the prior Friday!! Its been several days since payday and nobody knows where my paycheck is........they get real butt hurt if you quit, so if your stuck at REDACTED, I suggest you quit right after receiving your paycheck and pray they send the ones still owed to you in the mail.. If I were John Burgess (the owner) I would start fixing my tarnished lead database. (it isn't hard to do) If those 65%of bad leads i mentioned were fixed it would raise sales by 65%. AND I WOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PAY EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE AND NOT FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF OTHERS!!","G972U"

Learning & Training: Management provided me hands on experience of using different recruiting tools like LinkedIn, Monster, Naukri.com and various platforms of social media. Ive learnt the skill of Leadership Hiring.3. Reviews, Rewards & Recognition: Its a performance driven organization and reviews are held twice in a year. The feedback from my manager & seniors helped me improve.4. Professionalism & Personal life: REDACTED believes in ethics, humility and integrity which become a part of personality over a period of time. Work culture maintained in the organization is good; a lot of celebrations, training and employee engagement activities are done.For me REDACTED has been one of the few companies in recruitment sector in Delhi-NCR which follow the MNC culture.

Both bearing a lot of flaws.Hourly and salaried compensation is above average which is good!. Absolutely money hungry. They charge up the apartments far past the market average without consideration for the age or condition of the property. This puts a lot of stress on the on-site staff.Additionally, the bonus structure is dependent upon far too many factors. Commissions are reduced for any reason. You expect $50 for each move-in but you're left with $15 if they don't move-in almost immediately. You expect a $1,500 quarterly bonus but you're left with $500 if you go a cent over any of your budget line items.Upper management would rather force an applicant in to an apartment in order to increase occupancy without any concern for their 'preferred' move-in date. Leaving the applicant feeling pressured and unhappy.It is without question that little to no money is put back in to the property. Our budgets are shallow and prevent flexibility. So you're left with an old rickety property and no money to fix it.Again, this company seeks out the most financially beneficial route rather than the happy resident route.Write-ups are distributed for work related occurrences. Can't meet delinquency goals? Well you will be written up.I've never worked for a company that is so scattered and unorganized. You will never utilize a company specific form. Instead you are responsible for generating your own forms at a property level. Email typos from upper management, tacky resident notices, total lack of brand management, just to name a few.They don't even have an operations manuals. Nothing is uniformed!They still utilize paper time sheets... Yep... Paper. Get your fingers ready, you have to submit a last minute report for almost everything and anything.

The office is also very friendly and it was a very relaxed atmosphere.. The knowledge you learn technical wise does not really transfer. The knowledge you do get will be as basic as possible but is still semi useful for someone coming out of college but not for someone who is experienced. There is also not much room for growth as although they do have a ""checklist"" system to promote you, even if you get everything done on it there is a waiting list or they just may choose to not promote you for whatever reason. They also pay way below the industry standard but if it's your first job it's something you can deal with.Bottom Line:Great to get experience but definitely not somewhere to form your career..

It is straight up commission and in addition to that, even if a sale is made, there is still a window of time where if the sale is canceled a short time after that you dont get paid at all. That means all the hard work and walking and talking you do can go away just because a customer changed their mind.When I got the call from one of the admins to come in for an interview I asked is this a sales job? I want to make sure Im making money. She said starting pay is $30,000 That is if everything goes perfect and a sale is made every day. My advice, only take this job if sales is your thing and if this is something you deep down want to do. Otherwise, if you are looking for a steady pay job and really need to make money this is not for you. The only people really thriving are the ones at the top for as long as everyone underneath them are working hard and making sales they get paid no matter what, you are working for them!Yes you are trained and taught the 8 great work habits but even if you do everything correctly there is no guarantee. A fun atmosphere they conduct in the office is not how you get paid but how many people you sign up in the field. I especially dont like driving all over the place and not getting any compensation for it. Ultimately if you are looking for a job that will pay every week and are in it for the money then TURN BACK NOW.Side note, Dana and Darrell were the 2 of the 3 CEOs when I started there, and they were let go. What does that tell you?. Office nights should be optional. I didnt always have money on me to go out to the places chosen. After a hard days work in the field I just needed to go home and relax and eat for free!

You get the benefits of a small company (ability to have an impact and influence company direction, accessible management) without the instability of bleeding edge startups that may go out of business anytime. REDACTED has an impressive customer list, including hundreds of the most prestigious medical groups and hospitals. I find employees I interact with to be experienced and hardworking, and willing to help out in areas of their expertise. I have worked at a huge consulting firm, and at a huge software development firm. I like the ability in a small firm to take on a high level of responsibility, develop a business area, see it to fruition, and then keep improving it.The pros of a small firm are you get to do everything.. The cons of a small firm are you have to do everything. REDACTED doesnt have huge support departments, so youll have one or two talented people helping you out but may need to do some legwork on your own.. Ive seen the management and infrastructure of REDACTED evolve over the past 10 years as the firm has grown. The challenge is keeping the right level of management and support departments to support the staff and fuel growth, without creating too much overhead. Mostly I think REDACTED has gotten it right. Id encourage mentoring managerial skills in all the top performers, with some organizational professional development.

Every 6 months everyone gets either a 'fast track' or a promotion! Some of the rosy salaries they offer are disguises in blessings. It makes it nearly impossible to expect a hike in your next job / or a job in the first place! My personal experience has been torturous, and it did affect my personal well-being to quite an extent. And I am clearly not referring to work pressures (which we youngsters must adapt to for our own good anyway) but the psychological trauma due to office politics and favouritism and lack of recognition to your work. Two-faced people. passing negative feedback to your managers, hampering your repute is an everyday thing here!. The organisation has now become a headless chicken - with 4 heads. Heavily confused, with no end in sight. Poor leaders making poor decisions, that too aggressively! Previous comments have already stated about the lack of vision and mission! The head sitting in US office, has eternally been an inside joke in India office. Please please buckle up dear REDACTED, and stop ruining careers!Advice to Candidates:I have never seen Management of any organisation for that matter, reading these comments on glassdoor, going back and implementing it, to bring about a change. So, please avoid this company, even if you dont have any other prospective opportunities!","F895Q"

"480","Make a lot of money in a short period of time if you are good at the job.. Company slams the client with high fees with little or no good outcomes. They are infamous for hurting the small business owner by charging them a high up fee for 3 days of work by their analysts. However, once they send a consultant to the company they start racking up huge hourly fees that in reality have little to no benefit to the business. They harass the owners of the business until they get money out of them for bad business advice that they can't connect to any real savings or benefit to the business. If the business owner refuses to pay they will squat on the premises of the business and stalk the business owner until the business owner becomes so frustrated that they will put the charges on a credit card to get them off their property. As a sales person I realized that no matter how good I was at selling in the end I did not want to be involved with an organization such as this and their business practices. I also realized that it was a good old boys club that was more like a popularity contest and less like a performance based organization. If you don't kiss up you won't get good appointments. You will be sent to the Inside Sales Department and sent in circles to chase your tail. They will consider you an outcast if you start to complain based on your observations of reality. Once I realized they were full of it I just changed my phone number and cut off all contact with them and went out and got a better job with a company that does what they say they are going to do. And now I don't have to worry about a bad reputation on the internet killing my sales. Funny thing is that now I can help businesses that were once screwed over by this awful company because I have been on the inside and know what it is REALLY like. Don't go to work there if you are smart and don't work with them if you are a business owner reading this!. Nothing can help you. You are criminals. You lost your law license for a reason. You don't respect women obviously and deserve the label you got when you had those women file a class action lawsuit against you and go on Oprah to complain. Your business is going to fail no matter how many times you change the name. You have damaged a whole industry of consultants that actually do good work and have to prove that they are NOT you. Sadly, you will never change and not take away anything good from this. But it's obvious you are going out of business since you had to fire so many people that have been with you for over 10-15 years. Those people will go to work at other companies and work against you no matter what flimsy peice of paper you made them sign. Ha!","Y763L"

Honestly, working for REDACTED has been absolutely great, and there have just been a couple of tiny things that I've seen in my time here.- Because REDACTED is a global company, sometimes working hours can be all over the place (this hasn't happened to me a lot, but there's times when it can be a little stressful)- There hasn't been a lot of opportunities to take classes or get certifications (APICS)- Because there's the freedom to work from wherever, sometimes there's instances where you can go a whole project without seeing team memberes face to face (they live in another state/country). Makes it difficult to learn from/get direction- On-boarding process for out of college grads doesn't feel structured, leads to instances where there can be a lot of down-time between projects where you're trying to find something to do.

The partners get a commission of each assignment they bring in (rather than sharing equally among the partners in the firm as is the case with other exec search firms) so there are a lot of sharp elbows rather than a team/company spirit. That, combined with a lack of leadership (in terms of setting a good example and professionalism) amongst the partners and managerial staff, leads to an unpleasant atmosphere in the office..

The virtual office model worked well for allowing individuals to live all over the country (with special permission needed for the west coast). This provided flexibility when dealing with restrictions due to significant others or children. The CEO, Adam Gutstein and former CEO, current Chairman, Mel Bergstein are class acts. There is a genuine thoughtfulness and prudence in their approach to leading the company (from an Senior Associate's perspective).. Salary was always playing catch-up to the McKinsey's, Bain's and BCG's, as a result was always seemed a bit behind. The performance review process seems a bit vague and effort does not always link to rewards (more bonus than promotion, but promotion could be affected as well). First level bonuses are almost unheard of and drop off precipitously after this mark. Work can be dynamic and interesting, but there are a gaggle of mundane projects as well. The project on which one is staffed is ""the luck of the draw"", but there is room in the system to advocate for the most interesting projects (as they do exist).. - Reconfigure the bonuses to actual incentivize individuals to strive towards Level 1 bonuses- Provide more transparency to the performance review process- Maintain a healthy rotation of human capital throughout projects to ensure that employees who would like to obtain a varied industry or functional experience are able to do so (i.e. shorten the employee project tenure even if engagement project tenure lasts longer)","H675A"

Certain people who have more interest in gaining power strongholds within this company are allowed to get away with unethical behaviour. This is not the company it once was as people are more interested in playing office politics rather than focussing on the job at hand and what is good for the company. Senior management need to show loyalty to their employees but the rate of redundancies, way of communicating, lack of bonuses for the vast majority of employees (or even pay increases!) whilst senior staff are rewarded the lions share of the company's profits shows the little respect they have for the vast majority of the workforce here.","A907P"

"664","A company that has embraced change. A lot has happened since 2011-12. There were accounting irregularities, previous CEO was let go and new CEO came and did sweeping changes, including trimming middle management fat and getting the company back to profitability. The company is doing major alliances in the cloud space and bought niche companies in order to build competencies across various areas.. Because REDACTED has bought around 5 companies in one year plus it has announced merger with HPE, this is a period of immense uncertainty. Acquired entities were obviously bought at a premium and so REDACTED is now squeezing these to recover the costs. Integrations are going on but this is a rough time. Some people have been let go, others have lost their positions, salaries, benefits and power. In the process, company is losing some good talented people and real talent is always costly to recruit and rare to find.. Stop the madness. Instead of focus on cost cutting all the time, put some thoughts and energy on revenue generation by building and selling world class products and services. If frugality is important, please practice what you preach.","N198N"

While the work was intersting, there wasn't much of it so there were a lot of slow days. But the worst part was my sudden termination. I was called into a meeting by my manager, who was not even in the office. I met with HR in a conference room and my manager let me go over the phone. No warnings were ever given prior to this meeting. I was never put on any sort of corrective action, and when asked, no specfic details were given as to the reason behind this decision, which tends to make me believe it wasn't his decision, but rather someone in upper management. This happened on a Monday, and I wasn't even allowed to finish the week. It was a huge slap in the face by people I was starting to trust. My warning for anyone considering working for this company, be prepared for your job to end any day without reason or notice, as this was what happened to me. Maybe this is something they will change, but right now, it left me extremely dissatisfied with this company.. If you're planning on terminating someone's career, have the decency to let them know that their job is in jeopardy so that they have the chance to improve. And, if you ultimately reach the decision to end their career, be professional enough to do it in person, instead of waiting until you're out of the office so you can hide behind the phone. Also, letting them finish out the week, or waiting until a Friday might have been a nice thing to do as well.","Y914Y"

"668","REDACTED is a rapidly growing firm with tremendous market opportunities. Although the firm has many competencies on the provider side of healthcare, there are many untapped areas where ambitious associates can build a practice area. The firm promotes an entrepreneurial culture that, when managed appropriately, leads to great innovation and immense satisfaction among its associates.Individuals who can push through the late nights and days on the road are rewarded at the upper levels with generous bonus plans that reward the hungry and ambitious. Staff are treated well with in-office meals, fully stocked refrigerators and snacks, private offices, and social opportunities.Talent at the firm is top-notch. This is no place for individuals who like to be comfortable. You are usually surrounded by the best and the brightest. Someone is always pushing to get further than previously reached. That keeps smart individuals on their toes but sharp elbows can also hinder progress of others.. Rapid growth has eroded the traditional culture of the firm which may not be an overall negative. The firm has nearly doubled in the last two years, largely through a series of acquisitions and strategic senior hires. Much focus has been placed on these individuals and groups who have brought considerable but narrow expertise in specific practice areas. The addition of so many outside leaders without corresponding junior staff have led to a top-heavy structure.The delivery model has changed from a regional/generalist one to a national/specialist structure and a number of senior staff have been caught in the transition as reporting relationships and client focuses are shuffled. Some have benefitted while other have found themselves fighting to regain position or find a new area of focus.The continued insistence on an office-based culture that is becoming increasingly irrelevant is frustrating to some. Many beautiful offices sit relatively empty throughout the week as project managers and project officers travel or live away from office locations. This leaves junior staff often working alone in a quiet lonely office for days at a time. Much of the dollar investment on space could be redirected elsewhere if hoteling were to be implemented in offices where average daily occupancy is low.. Invest the time and money to continue to build the culture. Focus on creating a workplace and work style that will still be relevant in 10-15 years. Seek to recruit and retain mid-level talent to support projects.","N601F"

They don't allow property workers to have pictures of their family in their office! They don't back their employees: they take advantage of their reliable, hard workers, and keep employees who call in to work so much so that the employee doesn't get paid because the sick time ran out. They make their supervisors exempt status so they can't get OT, but of course don't pay a supervisor salary. You will make less money with this company. When they take over your property, they also take away your vacation time. If you had 3 or 4 weeks, you drop down to 2 because they don't care about you and that you've been at the same property for over 5 years. They do nothing to support the managers at the property and make it impossible to get rid of the employees who don't show up to work. Which of course, the supervisor who gets paid minimal has to pick up the slack and has to constantly be away from their family just to take care of a property that is old and for a company who simply doesn't care..

People are expected to work many hours (more than 80 a week in some cases) and not always record these to maintain profit margins.Several senior managers have never supervised anyone and are placed into these positions without any training. This has led to quite a bit of tension between engineers and program managers. Several micro-manage while others are completely hands-off, there is needs to be more of middle of the road approach so engineers have consistency across projects..

The work is interesting and varied (typical projects last about 5 weeks) and everyone is incredibly smart.

"803","Clean offices, top-notch technology, conveniently located for where I lived at the time. Non-executive colleagues were professional and supported each other well. Executive staff is personable.. Lack of leadership from the top executives results in dysfunctional workplace environment. Company has no strategic plan, no business development plans and no structure for growth or sustainability. Hiring and firing occurs at whiplash speed with no explanation given to staff. Continual restructuring and resistributing of executive responsibilities leads to confusion -- support staff is constantly having to report to different managers at different times. For a management and training company they have a remarkably unenlightened view on training their own staff. Leadership places new hires and personnel in management positions with no training or relevant experience related to the position. Virtually every employee has, at one time or another, been handed the baton for ""business development"" and not a single one of them had/has any background or experience in that area. Support staff is often given the responsibility for securing new business, managing and writing proposals and structuring management solutions without the necessary authority or experience. Staff is often expected to burden repsonsibilities far above their paygrade, picking up the slack left by the executive team.Support and non-supervisory staff do have experience with proposal writing, proposal management, contract management, budget management and pricing. However, executive staff disregards this experience and continues to employ the same losing strategies upon which they have always relied. Company mantra is ""if it hasn't worked so far, just keep hitting your head against that wall until it caves.""Ridiculous amount of administration required to complete simple tasks. COO's coordinator is working out of Alabama, so all tasks have to be routed through him/her before getting to anyone else in the office. All staff responses also have to be routed to Alabama before proceeding. Proposals are monitored out of Alabama while all the actual work (writing, managing, editing, researching) is completed in Dumfries by the non-management staff. Still all pieces of the proposals are sent to Alabama and then forwarded to your colleague across the hall for changes, edits, etc.. Get some training for your staff. Attend management and executive-level training courses yourselves. Hire a CEO who lives in the area and who has some management experience outside the military. Hire a COO who stays in the office beyond 3pm or better yet, one that actually works in the office rather than ""from home."" Eliminate the added layer of unnecessary administration so tasks can be completed more efficiently.

REDACTED values each career professional far above standard, starting with a thoughtful gift that arrived upon signing my contract for employment. What a surprise to come home and see this on the front doorstep. Another generous gift awaited me on my first day employed with REDACTED to continue to set the welcoming tone. REDACTED offers a new employee orientation that is very organized and offers extensive training and material to become familiar with firm policy and procedures. A staff member in each REDACTED location is available to get you any supply or office need required to be as productive as possible. Additionally, I was paired up with a Peer Mentor available for leadership. REDACTED offers a tremendous amount of personal leave days to each employee to ensure a healthy work life balance. The above standard REDACTED office environment offers ample snacks and drinks to make working hours as comfortable and productive as possible. These treats are constantly kept new and are extremely health and dietary need conscious. Quarterly social events with other staff members help create a cohesive team environment that I truly feel happy to be part of. A firm wide staff meeting happens more than once a year, that goes into detail about the performance and plans going forward for the firm. A beyond generous holiday staff event is held yearly to thank us for all the hard work. REDACTED is a phenomenal first class firm. A committee is in place to plan events that give back to our community, which again reinforces the true extraordinary nature of each person hired to work at this company. No special detail missed and REDACTED takes the time to show they care about each client and each career professional on an ongoing basis. REDACTED is made up of a very warm group of professionals, across the departments, and across the states, in each of REDACTEDs office locations, whom are exceptional to work along the side of.

You'll have to love processes to enjoy the work at REDACTED; this is what REDACTED does and is good at. The firm will never reach the status of McKinsey and BCG, primarily because it attracts average, risk-averse talent. Pay is worse than the industry; for example, as a Pricinple, you make on average less than $200K/year, while at BCG you make around $350K. And then the work is tedious, because it's all process (not content) focused.If you're serious about management consulting, skip REDACTED. It just doesn't pay off in the long run..

"906","1. Dubai is a great city to live in2. Consultants learn a lot during their tenure at REDACTED. 1. Senior Management doesn't know how to run the firm, lead the employees and treat their employees2. A yelling manager is what they think it takes to get work done. They don't even know the meaning of the word 'respect'3. Most other consulting firms make their employees work hard and most of their employees don't mind it. Here, they make you work hard and treat you like dirt4. They lie, lie, lie and then they lie even more (to the client, employees and probably to their families as well5. They promise the client a consultant's full time on the job and make the consultant work on 3 or 4 such projects. Why? Please refer to point 46.Senior Management takes a time management session and the session starts 6 hours late!! Even trains in India do better than that7. They state that they don't fire anyone and they fired at least 2 consultants in the last 1 year. Not that firing is a crime, but why lie about it?8. After a four hour review of a document, most times they find 7 synonym changes to be done, 2 commas to be added and 4 full stops to be removed so as to meet the so-called 'standard format'. Adding anything valuable is not seen from senior management in most cases9. A document is reviewed by a manager and he changes everything about it. His manager reviews it and he changes everything again. At the end of all these reviews, it turns out sometimes that the original produced by the consultant has been the final output. All of the changes have been given so that they can show their 'value add'10. Most of the senior management have done their MBAs from relatively unknown colleges OR claim to have an MBA even though what they have done is not an MBA (Why? Did you forget to refer to point 4 above? They can't even change jobs and therefore the treatment of consultants as dirt (as they feel threatened)11. They compare themselves to top tier consulting firms and pay 1/3rd salaries. Half the top-tier consulting firms don't even know that this firm exists (so much for comparison)12. Bonuses are typically paid a few months late in order to make consultants stick with them for those many months. How cheap...13. Can someone please tell them that a 2 day Harvard course doesn't mean a Harvard MBA and not tell clients that they studied at Harvard. Some old fellow at Harvard might have a heart attack reading this line. May god bless his soul14. I have at least 100+ more Cons to add, but it is better to leave it at this and summarize in a few words 'NOT QUITTING IMMEDIATELY IS A HUGE MISTAKE'.

It's not just that when you go to them for help, they will help you. People literally rush to you and check whether you are dealing ok or if you need any help.I've interned with other companies before. I feel that with many other companies, it's difficult to fit in as a new-comer because everyone knows each other's stories and/or histories and it's almost rude to break in by asking. And when those topics come up, you just feel so uninvolved and it's almost like you don't exist. But in REDACTED, whenever an inside joke comes up, people always remember that you exist and would always explain to you what happened. It's thoughtful details like this that make me feel 'loved' in this company (it's weird to use such a word in a corporate setting but it's true)..

Administrative units and colleges tend to operate in silos, so the culture is inconsistent. In my administrative department there seem to be many conservative values and lack of strategic planning, though this is not true of the University as a whole. While employee loyalty is appreciated, it is also important to hold everyone equally accountable to their job duties, and this is not always done. I am not valued by some as a female manager..

Employees only valued by the amount of billable hours performed, not in skills, customers brought in, or satisfaction level of said customers. When there isn't enough work, you will receive the scorn, and the blame, and may be written up via email, which is completely unprofessional. Company sticks with ancient technology (hardware/software long beyond their expiration date), ignores employee recommendations until something catastrophic happens (and it does, and the business loses customers), then you better keep your mouth shut when you were proven right.. Sell the company. The round-robin ""which employee should I pick on this month"" style of company leadership is a one-way ticket to the door for all, and explains the excessive turnover in recent months.","M613F"

The company tries to develop people instead of burning them out.Offers great flexibility for personal development and room to grow. You will usually get client exposure and responsibility fairly quickly and you also have very knowledgeable mentors by your side for guidance.The atmosphere within the company is great. People are very helpful, collaborative and that was a key aspect I really valued during my whole time there. They use company events to foster this culture (regular team dinners, ski trips,) and bring people together.. Depending on the project, the industry might not be as glamorous but you usually work on projects that have immediate P&L relevance and high priority for the management.The brand name is not as recognized globally as others are.There is less flexibility to influence the industry you are working in. You are assigned to projects given your previous expertise and have not that many opportunities to dive into an industry of your choice.. Keep fostering the Syn-Culture.

In many instances client employees asked whether it was a contracting firm. REDACTED is notorious for lack of organized training. If you are lucky enough to be on a good project with an experienced Partner you will learn a lot. It was very difficult for me to find previous work or intellectual property I could leverage for client work. As a result, I had to rely on the web or reinvent again. I didn't see a lot of fresh thinking or truly ground breaking intellectual capital come out of the firm. That may be a result of the culture where every Partner is so focused on client delivery that true intellectual property is not developed.

Management is excellent and has great communication with employees - I always felt like I knew what was going on in the business and what the strategic direction was for the firm.. My biggest drawback is the lack of name recognition. This is something that REDACTED has been working on, but it can be very frustrating, both for selling work and for selling yourself (be it on a resume, with others, etc). For people who know the firm, REDACTED always has a stellar, shining reputation and people are impressed to hear that you work there. However, most will not know the firm.

Ultimately, he should be more willing to take more chances with letting his team take the lead in an area instead of trying to personally micromanage all areas.","O948K"

Expanding at very fast rate, almost too fast due to excellent relationships with developers and business acumen of Division Presidents. Excellent compensation. Community Managers have a lot of freedom to pay employees adequate wages. Cannot attest to corporate office compensation but Community Managers are paid well and the Community Manager is the biggest decision maker in what their operations employees are paid, so any complaint from other reviewers about pay need not be directed at Corporate office but to the Community Manager. Very good insurance, 25% match on 401k. Good opportunity to move around the country.. VP's are the Regional Operations Directors and are spread WAY too thin. Cannot maintain adequate connection to all communities and do not provide enough support to Community Managers. No corporate game plan to deal with troubled communities, those with major issues out of the control of management. Community Managers are then left to their own devices rain or shine. As the VP's are spread too thin, when problems arise, they do not have the time to assist and so out of self preservation, and being the sole connection between the Community Manager and upper management, they are forced to misrepresent the situation to upper management. As stated above they are expanding maybe too rapidly and the pressure is all on the Regional VP's. Not enough employee connection events. In time with company there was only one employee event, an hour of appetizers and a couple of drinks at a restaurant. Know that if you are hired as a CM, you are on your own. 98% of communities were acquired in development phase and because of this they are able to set operations up for success right from the start but unless the issue is addressed, the have no business bringing on troubled or existing communites because they dont know how to deal with them.. Do not spread VP's so thin. Develop specific game plan for dealing with existing troubled communities, and train VP's in this methodology. In Community Management there will always be these communities. Don't just automatically take on the business, evaluate whether they can ever be successful or successful enough.","K779V"

The company works like any normal consulting-services company in India. This means that clients approach the company for access to the leadership and thinking that they would not access anywhere else; at the same time this means that the company has more senior team members than a normal manufacturing or process-led organization.This makes for a very different work experience where one is exposed to big people and personalities clashing while strategic work being delivered.

No matter how many times you switch offices, company names, or refuse to answer the phones, everything that you have done to your current and former employees will follow you forever.

It can be hard to plan a weeknight social life due to the unpredictable nature of our work.

Also, somewhat of a slave to the economy - when things are going well, consulting is great, when business slows down, it gets pretty stressful. This is the same for all consulting firms though.

Management just seems determined to drive young people out of the firm.Its almost as if they are deliberately trying to discourage young talent from contributing to the firm's success. A few things that they just don't seem to get:- Most of the work can be done remotely, yet they insist on office presence for the sake of it. Everyone is expected to work nights and weekends, proving that the work can be done anywhere, yet people have to be in seats at certain times of the day in low energy office locations. Many of these are often in undesirable and difficult to access parts of the metropolitan area.- Virtually no transparency is given to the criteria for promotion.- Staff consultants have no quarterly or even annual financial incentives to perform above and beyond expectations. Management seems to be content with a docile workforce that slogs along trying to avoid negative feedback and that is the extend of their incentive structure.- Social interaction and energy levels within the office are lacking tremendously. Management has expected this to occur organically through affinity group development where groups organize around specific interest areas, but management invests little to actively cultivate this.- Adoption of technology is excruciatingly slow. Office instant messaging was adopted just as that technology became obsolete. Can you imagine if they implemented something like Slack? Don't bet on it.. Put some serious effort into financially rewarding performance at all levels and not just the senior manager level.Invest in leading edge communication technologies even if there is some potential risk involved.Catch up with the times on remote working arrangements, and stop discouraging or shaming individuals who are more productive when they are not shackled to a desk.","U254A"

"1315","REDACTED ist ein bekanntes deutsches Consulting-Unternehmen mit moderner Außendarstellung, aber intern zeigt das Unternehmens von sich ein ziemlich antiquiertes, unkollegiales und unbewegliches Bild.. Ungesunde Unternehmenskultur, auf Konfrontation und unnötige Aggressivität ausgerichtet. Kollegiales Verhalten wird nicht gefördert und Projektbetreuer bekommen keine effektive Unterstützung. Planung der Arbeitsaufgaben ist unmöglich, Arbeitsplatz ist skrupellos und keine sachgerechte Ausbildung für die Arbeitnehmer. Top-Manager finden ständig neue Wege, die Angestellten anzuschwärzen und ihnen in den Rücken zu fallen, um ihren eigenen Hintern zu retten. Hier wird Leistung nicht gefördert, ein Familienunternehmen, das von inkompetenten Familienmitgliedern geführt wird. Das EGO des höheren Managements ist völlig außer Kontrolle. Um es kurz zu sagen, wenn du dich selbst magst und dir dein Wohlergehen wichtig ist, dann halte dich von diesem Unternehmen fern.. Reine Zeitverschwendung, denn sie sind alle aus dem gleichen Holz geschnitzt. Zu empfehlen wäre, die Menschen mit mehr Respekt zu behandeln und die Mitarbeiter auszubilden. Man sollte ehrlich mit den Kunden umgehen und die Frage der CEO-Nachfolge ohne nepotistische Überlegungen klären.","G911S"

"1338","LADO is a breath of fresh air in Taiwan's English teaching/corporate training industry, which isn't generally known for its honest employers who are themselves English teaching professionals and transparent business practices. LADO's many pros include transparency over pay - you never have to worry if you are being paid a fair rate for your work, and you are always paid for meetings and creating specialized materials for seminars. They have a professional staff, many if not all of whom are ELT professionals themselves, employee-friendly policies aimed at reducing class postponements and cancellations and generally a courteous, honest and laid-back pro-employee atmosphere overall. They work with top companies and maintain good client relationships - you never hear a client complain about LADO, because their service is excellent yet unobtrusive. Management understands the mindset of foreign employees so culture difference based disagreements are not an issue.. There are no real downsides to working for LADO itself. Business English in general is not for everyone - the hours can be a bit unpredictable and, as classes are planned around businesspeople's schedules, split shifts and other downsides are common. However, such things are endemic to the industry and are not related to LADO specifically.. Keep up the great work!","G192U"

Dont expect promotion even if you work hard.Dodgy senior management buy-out of the shareholders, staff lost money in our own company while the senior management benefitted.

At times the position can get overwhelming, I think it is in any position with customer, clients and in management. Also it definitely isn't the typical 9-5, I work a lot, which I don't mind due to the compensation, however you'll have to prepare yourself for hard work if you're not used to it.. You all keep a very fun and enjoyable work environment. My favorite aspect of this business is that I can go to management at anytime to sit down and talk.
