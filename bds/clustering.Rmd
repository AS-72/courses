There is no shortage of ways to cluster data. We can think of several large classes of cluster analyses.

Two of the bigger divisions are hard clustering and fuzzy clustering. Hard clustering algorithms assign observations to a specific cluster, whereas fuzzy clustering algorithms are probablistic in nature (i.e., an observation has a certain probability to belonging to any one cluster).



## Centroid Clustering

Centroid clustering is based upon distances around some centroid (maybe a mean). 



### k-means

```{r}
library(lavaan)

testData = HolzingerSwineford1939 %>% 
  select(starts_with("x"))
  

kmeansTest = kmeans(testData, 2)

plot(testData, col = kmeansTest$cluster)
```


### medoids

```{r}
library(cluster)

pamTest = pam(testData, k = 2)
```



## Distribution Clustering
